    <h2>Task-specific models</h2>
    <p>A foundational GPT model can be further adapted to produce more targeted systems directed to specific tasks and/or subject-matter domains. Methods for such adaptation can include additional <a title="In deep learning, fine-tuning is an approach to transfer learning in which the weights of a pre-trained model are trained on new data. Fine-tuning can be done on the entire neural network, or on only a subset of its layers, in which case the layers that are not being fine-tuned are 'frozen'.">fine-tuning</a> (beyond that done for the foundation model) as well as certain forms of <a title="Prompt engineering is the process of structuring text that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.">prompt engineering</a>.<a title="Bommasani (et-al), Rishi (July 12, 2022). 'On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models'.">[41]</a></p>
    <p>An important example of this is <a title="A large language model (LLM) is a type of language model notable for its ability to achieve general-purpose language understanding and generation.">fine-tuning models to follow instructions</a>, which is of course a fairly broad task but more targeted than a foundation model. In January 2022, <a title="OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research organization consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc.">OpenAI</a> introduced "InstructGPT"—a series of models which were fine-tuned to follow instructions using a combination of <a title="Supervised learning (SL) is a paradigm in machine learning where input objects and a desired output value train a model. The training data is processed, building a function that maps new data on expected output values.">supervised</a> training and <a title="In machine learning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), including reinforcement learning from human preferences, is a technique that trains a 'reward model' directly from human feedback and uses the model as a reward function to optimize an agent's policy using reinforcement learning (RL) through an optimization algorithm like Proximal Policy Optimization.">reinforcement learning from human feedback</a> (RLHF) on base GPT-3 language models.<a title="'Aligning language models to follow instructions'. openai.com.

'Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback'.">[43]</a> Advantages this had over the bare foundational models included higher accuracy, less negative/toxic sentiment, and generally better alignment with user needs. Hence, OpenAI began using this as the basis for its <a title="An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other.">API</a> service offerings.<a title="Ramnani, Meeta (January 28, 2022).

    <p>Another (related) kind of task-specific models are chatbots, which engage in human-like conversation. In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT—an online chat interface powered by an instruction-tuned language model trained in a similar fashion to InstructGPT.<a title="'Introducing ChatGPT'. openai.com. Archived from the original on 2023-03-16. Retrieved 2023-03-16." href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt" target="_blank">[47]</a> They trained this model using RLHF, with human AI trainers providing conversations in which they played both the user and the AI, and mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset for a conversational format suitable for a chatbot. Other major chatbots currently include <a title="Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington.">Microsoft</a>'s <a title="Microsoft Copilot is a chatbot assistant introduced by Microsoft as Bing Chat on February 7, 2023. Over the course of 2023, Microsoft began to unify the Copilot branding across its various chatbot products.">Bing Chat</a>, which uses OpenAI's GPT-4 (as part of a broader close collaboration between OpenAI and Microsoft),<a title="Wiggers, Kyle (May 4, 2023). 'Microsoft doubles down on AI with new Bing features'." href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/microsoft-doubles-down-on-ai-with-new-bing-features/" target="_blank">[48]</a> and Google's competing chatbot <a title="Bard is a conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google, based initially on the LaMDA family of large language models (LLMs) and later PaLM.">Bard</a> (initially based on their <a title="LaMDA is a family of conversational large language models developed by Google.

CNET." href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/chatgpt-vs-bing-vs-google-bard-which-ai-is-the-most-helpful/" target="_blank">[49]</a></p>
    <p>Yet another kind of task that a GPT can be used for is the <a title="Meta is a prefix meaning 'more comprehensive' or 'transcending'.">meta</a>-task of generating its own instructions, like developing a series of prompts for 'itself' to be able to effectuate a more general goal given by a human user.<a title="'Auto-GPT, BabyAGI, and AgentGPT: How to use AI agents'. Mashable. April 19, 2023." href="https://mashable.com/article/autogpt-ai-agents-how-to-get-access" target="_blank">[50]</a> This is known as an AI <a title="In computer science, a software agent is a computer program that acts for a user or another program in a relationship of agency.">agent</a>, and more specifically a recursive one because it uses results from its previous self-instructions to help it form its subsequent prompts; the first major example of this was <a title="Auto-GPT is an open-source 'AI agent' that, given a goal in natural language, will attempt to achieve it by breaking it into sub-tasks and using the internet and other tools in an automatic loop.">Auto-GPT</a> (which uses OpenAI's GPT models), and others have since been developed as well.<a title="Marr, Bernard.

        <h3>Multimodality</h3>
        <p>Generative transformer-based systems can also be targeted to tasks involving <a title="In the context of human–computer interaction, a modality is the classification of a single independent channel of input/output between a computer and a human.">modalities</a> beyond text.</p>
        <p>For example, Microsoft’s “Visual ChatGPT” combines ChatGPT with visual foundation models (VFMs) to enable input or output comprising images as well as text.<a title="'Microsoft Open-Sources Multimodal Chatbot Visual ChatGPT'. InfoQ." href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/04/microsoft-visual-chatgpt/" target="_blank">[52]</a> Also, advances in text-to-speech technology offer powerful tools for audio content creation when used in conjunction with foundational GPT language models.<a title="Edwards, Benj (January 9, 2023). 'Microsoft's new AI can simulate anyone's voice with 3 seconds of audio'.
