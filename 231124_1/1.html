    <h3>Initial developments</h3>
    <p>Generative pretraining (GP) was a long-established concept in machine learning applications,<a title="Hinton (et-al), Geoffrey (October 15, 2012).

'Attention Is All You Need'">[16]</a> That development led to the emergence of large language models such as <a title="Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a family of language models introduced in October 2018 by researchers at Google.">BERT</a> in 2018<a title="Devlin, Jacob; Chang, Ming-Wei; Lee, Kenton; Toutanova, Kristina (May 24, 2019).

'Google Introduces New Architecture To Reduce Cost Of Transformers'">[18]</a> Also around that time, in 2018, <a title="OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research organization consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc.">OpenAI</a> published its article entitled "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training," in which it introduced the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) system (<a title="Generative Pre-trained Transformer 1 (GPT-1) was the first of OpenAI's large language models following Google's invention of the transformer architecture in 2017.">"GPT-1"</a>).<a title="Radford, Alec; Narasimhan, Karthik; Salimans, Tim; Sutskever, Ilya (11 June 2018).

    <p>Prior to transformer-based architectures, the best-performing neural NLP (<a title="Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language.">natural language processing</a>) models commonly employed <a title="Supervised learning (SL) is a paradigm in machine learning where input objects and a desired output value train a model. The training data is processed, building a function that maps new data on expected output values. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine output">supervised learning</a> from large amounts of manually-labeled data. The reliance on supervised learning limited their use on datasets that were not well-annotated, and also made it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to train extremely large language models.<a title="Radford, Alec; Narasimhan, Karthik; Salimans, Tim; Sutskever, Ilya (11 June 2018).

    <p>The <a title="Weak supervision, also called semi-supervised learning, is a paradigm in machine learning, the relevance and notability of which increased with the advent of large language models due to large amount of data required to train them.">semi-supervised</a> approach OpenAI employed to make a large-scale generative system—and was first to do with a transformer model—involved two stages: an <a title="Unsupervised learning is a paradigm in machine learning where, in contrast to supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, algorithms learn patterns exclusively from unlabeled data.">unsupervised generative</a> "pretraining" stage to set initial parameters using a language modeling objective, and a supervised <a title="Discriminative models, also referred to as conditional models, are a class of logistical models used for classification or regression.

    <p>Regarding more recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer#Foundational_models">GPT foundation models</a>, <a title="OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research organization consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc.">OpenAI</a> published its first versions of <a title="Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a large language model released by OpenAI in 2020.">GPT-3</a> in July 2020.
