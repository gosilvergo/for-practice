    <p>Thus far, the most notable GPT foundation models have been from <a title="OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research organization consisting of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc.">OpenAI</a>'s GPT-n series. The most recent from that is GPT-4, for which OpenAI declined to publish the size or training details (citing "the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models").<a title="OpenAI (2023).

    <p>Other such models include Google's <a title="PaLM is a 540 billion parameter transformer-based large language model developed by Google AI.

    <p>Foundational GPTs can also employ <a title="In the context of human–computer interaction, a modality is the classification of a single independent channel of input/output between a computer and a human. Such channels may differ based on sensory nature, or other significant differences in processing .">modalities</a> other than text, for input and/or output. GPT-4 is a multi-modal LLM that is capable of processing text and image input (though its output is limited to text).<a title="Islam, Arham (March 27, 2023).
